# Rules

## Variable Rules

1. **No Variable Shadowing:** Prevent variables within a block from masking wider scope variables with the same name.
2. **No Unused Variables:** Flag variables declared but never used.
3. **Mandatory Initialization:** All variables must be assigned a value during declaration.
4. **Constant by Default:** Variables are immutable by default, but can be explicitly declared as mutable if needed.
