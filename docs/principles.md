# Constitution

The compiler enforces the following principles to ensure efficient and clear coding standards:

1. **Limited Choice:** The language design should restrict multiple ways to accomplish the same task. This simplification aids in code consistency and reduces confusion for developers when choosing the best approach.

2. **Enforce Best Practices:** The syntax and type system should incorporate best practices. This integration helps developers write optimal code without needing extra tools or external guidelines.

3. **Explicit Errors:** The compiler provides error messages that are not only clear but also include suggestions for corrections. This helps developers quickly understand and resolve issues in their code.

4. **Convention over Configuration:** Most behaviors and patterns should be defined by default conventions, requiring minimal additional setup. This approach reduces configuration overhead and lets developers focus on writing their code.

5. **No Hidden Magic:** The language should operate transparently, minimizing unexpected behavior. Developers should understand exactly what their code does without relying on hidden or implicit features.

6. **No Unnecessary Features:** The focus is on essential features required for mainstream development, avoiding feature bloat.

7. **Standard Library:** All libraries included in the standard distribution must adhere to a predefined quality standard.

8. **Prioritize Readability:** Developers should be able to quickly grasp what the code does due to its clarity and conciseness.

9. **Unit Tests:** Unit tests must be placed close to the code they verify. Unit tests should be easy to integrate and should enhance the main codebase rather than obstruct it.

10. **Documentation:** The syntax should be self-explanatory, thus removing the need for excessive comments or external documentation like JSDoc. This encourages code that is inherently understandable.
