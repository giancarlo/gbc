1. **Return Codes:** Functions can return specific integer codes that indicate success (e.g., 0) or different types of errors (e.g., -1 for file not found, -2 for invalid input). The calling code needs to check the return code and handle the error appropriately.

2. **Error Monad:** This is a functional programming concept where a wrapper type (monad) holds either a valid value or an error message. Functions can return this monad, propagating errors through the code. Specific functions can then handle or extract the value from the monad.

3. **Result Type:** Similar to the error monad, you can define a result type with two variants: `Ok(value)` for successful execution and `Err(error_message)` for errors. Functions return this result type, allowing clear separation of successful results and errors.

4. **Option Type:** This type can represent either a value (`Some(value)`) or the absence of a value (`None`). This is useful for functions that might not always have a valid result due to errors or optional data.

**Choosing the Right Mechanism:**

The best approach depends on your language's design and goals. Here's a breakdown to help you decide:

-   **Return Codes:** Simple and efficient, good for low-level operations and system calls. Can be less readable for complex error handling.
-   **Error Monad/Result Type:** More functional approach, promotes code clarity and composability. Might require some learning curve for programmers unfamiliar with these concepts.
-   **Option Type:** Useful for optional data and handling potential absence of values. Less flexible for complex error scenarios.

**Additional Considerations:**

-   **Error Messages:** Regardless of the chosen mechanism, provide clear and informative error messages to help developers identify and fix the issue.
-   **Logging:** Consider integrating logging capabilities to capture error details and assist with debugging.

By implementing one of these alternatives, you can provide a robust error handling mechanism for your language without relying on exceptions.
