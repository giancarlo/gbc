## Hello World

This is a sample of a simple "Hello World" program. The _main_ block is our entry point. No code is allowed outside of it other than type and function definitions. The standard library is always available through the _@_ operator. The pipe `>>` operator will call the `@.out` function passing its left value as an argument.

```
main { 'Hello World' >> @.out }
```
