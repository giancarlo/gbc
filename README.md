# GB Compiler Framework

The GB Compiler (GBC) framework is a modular toolset that attempts to simplify the creation of compilers, particularly for languages targeting JavaScript and WebAssembly.

## Projects

-   [Compiler Framework](https://github.com/giancarlo/gbc/tree/main/sdk): The SDK provides tools for syntax parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation, offering a foundation for building custom compilers.
-   [GB Language](https://github.com/giancarlo/gbc/tree/main/compiler): The GB programming language is a concise, type-safe, and functional language emphasizing immutability, modular design, and streamlined syntax, utilizing block-based execution with pipelines, strong typing with inference, and features like generics, closures, and streams.
